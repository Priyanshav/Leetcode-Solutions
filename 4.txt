I took a new array because it was not feasible to store the elements of the second array in the first one.

I declared the i,j,k pointer very carefully, keeping the sizes of the array in mind.

Median:
    If the size of new array is odd then the middle element will be the median.
    If the size of new array is even then median will be the sum of two middle elements divided by 2 (average of middle elements).

The time complexity of this solution is 0(m + n), but it can be improved.
